            <h2 class="head" >Code Hour</h2> 
            <p id="blog">We conducted a #HourofCode event at “Young Talent’s Lyceum”. The main aim of code hour is to introduce basic coding algorithms to school children. Therefore, we invited 7. class students to our event. 
                The event was held a place at 10th November at 9 o’clock. During 1 hour, we give brief information about ADA University, showed code-org puzzles, and tried to write some codes in C language. Firstly, we started with a presentation about ADA university. Then, code org puzzles and their principles were introduced. Students show high interest in puzzles and tried to solve them by themselves. In the end, at the request of the pupils, we wrote a program to calculate the average grade for students. Students were excited to see how to code in reality and calculated their grades. Finally, we conducted a question-answer session. Students asked questions about ADA university. how to code effectively and so on. Students who actively participated during the event got nice stickers and small gifts from us.
                Last but not least, we wanted to convey our thankfulness to Young Talent’s Lyceum, Arif Muellim, Konul Khanim, and Gunay Khanim who create suitable conditions for our event. I hope, these students were encouraged by our event and will be “special forces” in the IT field one day.

                   <p id="site">

                    We started to build our website from knowledge that learned from Code Academy`s courses. We firstly started to learn HTML, then CSS. We pushed our limits to learn HTML as fast as possible so that start to build our Web-site. 
	Our Web-site is called SHELS , consist of first letters of team members(Shamil , Elnara, Leyla ,Sabir). That is creative approach to find name for our web-site. Secondly, we designed logo for our website. 
	You can find our learning results in the code academy through that links:
